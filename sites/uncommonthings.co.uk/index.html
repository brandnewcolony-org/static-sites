          <p>We have been helping artists and galleries reimagine what &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; looks like for over 15 years and believe (especially now) that digital can &ndash; <em>and should</em> &ndash; be both playful and critical.</p>
          <p>We are available for curatorial projects, speaking engagements, writing, and consultation. If you&rsquo;re interested, you&rsquo;ll find more info and our contact at the end of the page.</p>

      <p>We love working with a single artist over a long period of time to develop their ideas. They bring their unique voice and perspective and we support them to craft it into an ambitious, welcoming and challenging space for an audience. We bring a strong knowledge of the digital and visual arts sectors; a keen eye for design; diverse experience with technical teams; and the ability to write for a wide range of audiences.</p>

      <p>We have worked both as curators, and as producers for the visions of other curators and artists. We take time to understand the value in any client&rsquo;s approach, and how to retain this throughout &ndash; making it the core element for any project. We start big, and ask what the dream would be. And then we find a way to access part of that and make it a reality, even on the tightest of budgets. We&rsquo;re problem solvers, negotiators, and endlessly curious.</p>

      <p>A big part of our careers has been mentoring and developing artists: supporting them to make new work, learn new skills, and meet the art world head-on. We believe in access and transparency, in demystifying both digital art and the mysteries of the art sector. This might range from teaching practical skills like navigating contracts and budgets; mentoring on how to advocate for your practice, or access needs; to simply guiding artists through exhibition opportunities.</p>

      <p>We&rsquo;re extremely passionate about what we do, and we get asked to talk about it quite a lot. From appearances on panels for events in art and tech, to writing for arts publications and guest lecturing on the arts courses of universities. Our areas of special interest are artist development; exhibition-making; the intersection of art and gaming; non-formal curatorial approaches; fundraising and commissioning; and bridging the gap between artist &amp; audience.</p>

    <div class="about-body">
      <p><strong>Lesley Taker</strong> (left) is a freelance curator, writer, and creative producer with over 15 years of experience in visual / digital art, and art &amp; technology. Her work is concerned with how digital culture reshapes contemporary art, particularly around fluid identities, shifting truths, and unstable narratives. She also works as an access producer, primarily supporting neurodivergent artists and curators to find funding and make work.</p>
      <p><strong>Charlotte Horn</strong> (right) is a curator and producer with over 13 years of experience across the visual arts and media sectors and is currently the Exhibitions Manager at FACT, Liverpool. Charlotte&rsquo;s curatorial practice is rooted in exhibition-making, with a strong focus on artist-led and collaborative production. Before working at FACT, she had worked at many arts organisations in the North West, including as a Director of The Royal Standard.</p>
      <p>We both have particular expertise in delivering large-scale installations, audio and moving image works, XR projects, artist development programmes, and public-realm artworks and events.</p>
